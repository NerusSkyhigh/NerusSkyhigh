Today is Morning Star-3, year 17 after the awakening. My name is William Trueman and today my dream will come true. Today is the day I finally start working as a Scout for the Rebuild Government. I'm so excited to start this new job. Since I made my first steps outside the spaceship when I was 3 years old, I've been wondering what secrets and materials lie beneath this ground and what are the main differences between this planet and the Earth. I know I'm going to find something new and make the difference for the Reconstruction!

```{note}
I took my time. And now that time has run out. I know what I want to do with my life: something new and multidisciplinary. Something no one I know has done before. But if I've never seen anyone do something like this, how can I do it first?

## Nothing to show

```{note}
I asked myself: what possible could I show the public that would be unique and spectacular?<br>
After a lot of thinking, I arrived at the ultimate solution: I have NOTHING to show.
