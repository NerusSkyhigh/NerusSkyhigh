##### Module 12 : Game Concept Design  
This module aimed at providing basics of concept design. The assignment were a _OneSheet Concept_ for an imaginary games and a _Character Study_ for a character of that game. You can fin them here:
- [Parrying Bullets - 1SheetConcept](/assets/documents/xamk/module12/Parrying_Bullets_-_1SheetConcept.pdf)
- [Character Study - Equi from Parrying Bullet.pdf](/assets/documents/xamk/module12/Character_Study_-_Equi_from_Parrying_Bullet.pdf)

Although I'm very proud of the first as it allowed me to define my ideas on Parrying Bullet, a game I thought about years before, the one that taught me a valuable lesson is the second. Drawing is not my cup of tea but doing it anyway allowed me to understand how even a bad draw can help in transmitting some key concepts.
