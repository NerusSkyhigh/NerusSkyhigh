# Hi, I'm Guglielmo Grillo aka NerusSkyhigh.

## About me
Hi, I'm a Master's physics student at Trento with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular classes (e.g. _Computational Physics_ (ay. 2021),  _Quantum computing_ (ay. 2021), _Intelligent optimization and machine learning_ (ay. 2019) ) and extracurricular (I took part in the 2021 edition of the _Cyberchallenge_; _Data Mining for Physicists_ (aa 2020) ). I'm one of the founding members of _Progetto Apollo_, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. My hobbies include skill-based videogames and parkour. Since 2019 I've been a tutor for the University of Trento (2019-2020 Calculus, 2021-today Laboratory of Physics).


## Projects:

### Personal projects:
#### Practical Deep Learning for Coders
> Personal project on hold due to lack of time

I'm taking the course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). If you are interested in my homework and projects, you can find them in [**this repository**](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/practicaldeeplearning)

# Magic TCG card recognition
A personal project that I'm carrying on with a friend of mine. We are not ready to disclose our project, but we aim to design a machine able to detect Magic TCG cards, sort them, and esteem the market value of a deck of cards.


### University:

#### Multi-scale methods in soft matter physics 
[Percolation - Github repository](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/percolation/): brief introduction to Bernoulli percolation with a review on the existence of the critical point, some slides I used to present the topic, and a Jupyter notebook containing a few interactive plot and simulations (like a Monte Carlo simulation for the critical probability) used to generate the images of the slides.


#### Computational Physics (Master course)
[Machine Learning Phases of Matter - Github repository](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/Machine-Learning-Phases-of-Matter): this project aims to reobtain the results presented in Machine learning phases of matter regarding the two-dimensional square Ising model.
Course assignments: coming soon

#### Laboratory of Advanced Electronics

Only part of the code is available. The rest needs to be polished. 


<!-- I believe that life can arise only from the opposites and, because of that, our lives are full of conflicts: love and differences, passions and work, play and study. Sometimes I feel that one life is not enough to do everything I wish to do. Yet, there is hope. If only I manage to find a balance between all these opposite forces. This is a portfolio where I collect all the things I do while trying to find balance. -->

## Parkour 🏃🔥
After spending many years without finding something I enjoy doing, I came across parkour in my second year of University. It was a revelation: parkour is freedom, rules, and challenges all at the same time. I'm not a pro, but I never miss an opportunity to challenge myself. My next goal is to manage to perform a front flip. During these times when gatherings are not the best idea, I tend to work out at home to be ready when we will be able to train outside once again.

## Videogames 🎮
Games are a big part of my life because they represent how I aim to live my life: with a good story worth being told, challenging, and always with more room for improvement.

Lately, I've been playing a lot of Doom Eternal, right now my goal is to beat again the DLC at Nightmare without using the Sentinel Armor during the last boss battle.
