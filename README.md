# Hi, I'm Guglielmo Grillo aka NerusSkyhigh.

## About me
Hi, I'm a Master's physics student at Trento with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular classes (e.g. _Computational Physics_ (ay. 2021),  _Quantum computing_ (ay. 2021), _Intelligent optimization and machine learning_ (ay. 2019) ) and extracurricular (I took part in the 2021 edition of the _Cyberchallenge_; _Data Mining for Physicists_ (aa 2020) ). I'm one of the founding members of _Progetto Apollo_, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodes√¨o. My hobbies include skill-based videogames and parkour. Since 2019 I've been a tutor for the University of Trento (2019-2020 Calculus, 2021-today Laboratory of Physics).

<!-- I believe that life can arise only from the opposites and, because of that, our lives are full of conflicts: love and differences, passions and work, play and study. Sometimes I feel that one life is not enough to do everything I wish to do. Yet, there is hope. If only I manage to find a balance between all these opposite forces. This is a portfolio where I collect all the things I do while trying to find balance. -->

## Parkour üèÉüî•
After spending many years without finding something I enjoy doing, I came across parkour in my second year of University. It was a revelation: parkour is freedom, rules and challenges all at the same time. I'm not a pro, but I never miss an opportunity to challenge myself. My next goal is to manage to perform a front flip. During these times where gatherings are not the best idea, I tend to work out at home to be ready when we will be able to train outside once again.

## Videogames üéÆ
Games are a big part of my life because they represent how I aim to live my life: with a good story worth to be told, challenging and always with more room for improvement.

Lately I've been playing a lot of Doom Eternal, right now my goal is to beat again the DLC at Nightmare without using the Sentinel Armor during the last boss battle.
