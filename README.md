# Hi, I'm Guglielmo Grillo aka NerusSkyhigh.

## About me
I’m a recently graduated Physicist (Master’s degree) at Trento with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular and extracurricular classes. I’m one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Since 2019 I’ve been a tutor for the University of Trento. My hobbies include video games and parkour.

## Projects:

### Personal Projects:

#### Practical Deep Learning for Coders
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/practicaldeeplearning)  
I'm taking the course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). If you are interested in my homework and projects, you can find them in [**this repository**](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/practicaldeeplearning)

#### Magic TCG card recognition
A personal project that I'm carrying on with a friend of mine. We are not ready to disclose our project, but we aim to design a machine able to detect Magic TCG cards, sort them, and esteem the market value of a deck of cards.


### University Projects:

#### "Percolation - Theory and Applications" - Multi-scale methods in soft matter physics 
[Percolation - Github repository](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/percolation/): brief introduction to Bernoulli percolation with a review on the existence of the critical point, some slides I used to present the topic, and a Jupyter notebook containing a few interactive plot and simulations (like a Monte Carlo simulation for the critical probability) used to generate the images of the slides.

#### Machine Learning Phases of Matter - Advanced Computational Physics
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/Machine-Learning-Phases-of-Matter)  
This project aims to reobtain the results presented in Machine learning phases of matter (Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko) regarding the two-dimensional square Ising model. The authors show that a standard feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is a suitable tool to detect Ising's model phase transition.

#### A Game of Life - Laboratory of Advanced Electronics

[notes (website)](https://nerusskyhigh.github.io/Advanced-Electronics/README.html)  
[FPGA Code and Exam project](https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/LoAE-code) 
Developed for the course Laboratory of Advanced Electronics including my final project that implements Conway's Game of Life on an FPGA and outputs the results using the VGA standard.

<!-- I believe that life can arise only from the opposites and, because of that, our lives are full of conflicts: love and differences, passions and work, play and study. Sometimes I feel that one life is not enough to do everything I wish to do. Yet, there is hope. If only I manage to find a balance between all these opposite forces. This is a portfolio where I collect all the things I do while trying to find balance. -->

## Parkour 🏃🔥
After spending many years without finding something I enjoy doing, I came across parkour in my second year of University. It was a revelation: parkour is freedom, rules, and challenges all at the same time. I'm not a pro, but I never miss an opportunity to challenge myself. My next goal is to manage to perform a front flip. During these times when gatherings are not the best idea, I tend to work out at home to be ready when we will be able to train outside once again.

## Videogames 🎮
Games are a big part of my life because they represent how I aim to live my life: with a good story worth being told, challenging, and always with more room for improvement.

Lately, I've been playing a lot of Doom Eternal, right now my goal is to beat again the DLC at Nightmare without using the Sentinel Armor during the last boss battle.
